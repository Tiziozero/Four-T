    - first bet your ante ("buy in bet")
        - usualy a small value decided by the table
    - dealer deals two cards to each player - secret
    - each player takes a look at their cards and choose wather or not to bet
    - whenever there's a betting round, you can choose to:
        - "fold"    : not playing this run
        - "check"   : matching their bet - not bet any additional money
            - you can only check if no one else has bet that round
            - if someone has already bet, you can choose to:
                - "call": match their bet/add same amount of money
                - "raise": add more money
                - "fold": not playing that turn
        - "raise"   : adding more money to the betting pool
        players unwilling to check a bet haave to fold
        if everyone but one player folds, that player wins
    - once everyone has bet, the dealer reveals three cards
        - known as the "flop"
    - when you see flop, start planing what hand you want to make

    - after flop, everyone has the chance to bet again
    - next card is revealed - the "turn"
    - after turn, everyone has the chance to bet again
    - next and last card is revealed - the "river"

        - two in your hand
        - five on the table
    - players will bet one last time
    - then hands are revealed
    - goal is to create the highest hand possible
